\section{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}

  We have examined whether two long-standing observational anomalies,
  namely flat galaxy rotation curves and the Hubble constant tension,
  may originate from a common effective mechanism operating in low-density environments.

  Using a minimal phenomenological framework characterized by a single saturation
  scale, we have shown that baryonic matter alone can reproduce the main features
  of observed galaxy rotation curves across a wide range of systems, without
  halo-by-halo tuning or the introduction of dark matter particles within this
  effective description.
  This conclusion is supported by direct comparisons with
  representative rotation curves from the SPARC sample.

  The same effective mechanism extends naturally to cosmological low-density regions.
  Cosmic voids, which probe the deepest saturation regime, emerge as key laboratories for
  this framework.
  In these environments, the locally inferred expansion rate is predicted to deviate systematically
  from the global value inferred from early-universe observables,
  while the background cosmological evolution remains unchanged.

  Crucially, the framework does not modify early-time physics,
  does not alter the global expansion history, and does not claim universal validity across all regimes.
  Quantities such as gravitational acceleration and the Hubble parameter
  are interpreted as effective inference rates, not as fundamental dynamical fields.

  The strength of the approach lies in its parsimony and falsifiability.
  All predictions follow from a single effective scale already constrained by galactic dynamics.
  No additional degrees of freedom or environment-dependent tuning are introduced.

  We have identified several observational tests capable of confirming or excluding the framework.
  These include correlations between inferred values of $H_0$ and large-scale environment,
  redshift-dependent suppression of the local offset, void-specific redshift drift,
  weak lensing signatures, and the dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies.

  Taken together, these results suggest that galaxy rotation curves and the
  Hubble tension may reflect a shared low-density phenomenology rather than
  independent failures of the standard cosmological model.
  Whether this effective description captures a genuine aspect of gravitational
  inference or represents an intermediate phenomenological layer will ultimately be
  decided by targeted observational tests in the coming years.
