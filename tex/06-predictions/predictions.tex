\section{Predictions and Observational Tests}
  \label{sec:predictions}

  The effective saturation framework introduced in this work leads to a set of
  distinct and testable predictions.
  These predictions arise directly from the environmental dependence of the
  effective dynamics and do not rely on additional assumptions or parameter
  tuning.

  \subsection{Environment-Dependent Hubble Measurements}
    \label{subsec:h0_environment}

    A primary prediction of the model is a correlation between the locally inferred
    Hubble constant and the surrounding large-scale environment.

    Observers and standard candles located in or near deep cosmic voids are expected
    to yield systematically higher values of $H_0$ than those located in denser
    regions.
    Conversely, measurements anchored in overdense environments should converge
    more closely toward the global expansion rate $H_{\mathrm{global}}$.

    This prediction can be tested by cross-correlating existing and forthcoming
    $H_0$ measurements with void catalogs and density reconstructions derived from
    large-scale galaxy surveys, as already explored in the context of local
    underdensity scenarios~\cite{Keenan2013KBC,Shanks2019Void,Kennworthy2019VoidCritique}.
    A null result would strongly disfavor the effective saturation mechanism.

  \subsection{Redshift Dependence of the Hubble Offset}
    \label{subsec:redshift_dependence}

    The environmental bias predicted by the model is inherently scale dependent.
    At sufficiently low redshift, local measurements are sensitive to individual
    large-scale structures and probe the saturated regime.

    At increasing redshift, line-of-sight averaging over multiple environments
    progressively suppresses the bias.
    As a result, the inferred expansion rate is predicted to converge smoothly
    toward $H_{\mathrm{global}}$.

    This behavior provides a clear observational signature.
    Measurements of $H_0$ performed over different redshift ranges should exhibit a
    systematic trend, with the largest deviations appearing at the lowest
    redshifts, consistent with expectations from environmental averaging
    arguments~\cite{Verde2019Review}.

    An important quantitative consequence of the framework is that the expected
    deviation remains at the percent level and peaks at intermediate redshift.
    Once the saturation scale is fixed by galactic dynamics, the model predicts
    that the fractional offset in the inferred expansion rate should be of order
    a few percent at $z \sim 1$, while remaining negligible at both very low and
    sufficiently high redshift.

    Such a deviation is within the sensitivity range of forthcoming large-scale
    surveys, including DESI and \textit{Euclid}, and provides a clear target for
    falsification.
    Deviations significantly larger or smaller than this level would directly
    challenge the proposed mechanism.

  \subsection{Void-Specific Redshift Drift}
    \label{subsec:redshift_drift}

    The effective saturation mechanism also affects the temporal evolution of
    redshift for sources embedded in low-density environments.

    In the standard cosmological framework, the redshift drift is determined solely
    by the global expansion history.
    In the present model, sources located in deep voids experience a modified
    effective expansion rate, leading to a small but systematic deviation in the
    expected redshift drift signal.

    Future high-precision spectroscopic experiments may be able to detect this
    environment-dependent drift by comparing sources located in voids and in
    denser regions, complementing existing proposals for redshift-drift
    measurements~\cite{Cai2017VoidLensing}.
    The effect is predicted to be absent at high redshift, where environmental
    averaging dominates.

  \subsection{Weak Lensing Signatures in Voids}
    \label{subsec:void_lensing}

    Because the effective dynamics modifies the gravitational response in
    low-density regions, it also affects weak gravitational lensing by cosmic
    voids.

    The model predicts subtle deviations in void lensing profiles compared to
    standard expectations.
    In particular, the effective saturation leads to a reduced lensing efficiency
    relative to what would be inferred from baryonic matter alone, without invoking
    additional dark components.

    Void lensing measurements therefore provide an independent probe of the
    framework, complementary to kinematic tests, and have already been identified
    as sensitive diagnostics of gravitational dynamics in underdense
    regions~\cite{Cai2017VoidLensing}.

  \subsection{Predictions for Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies}
    \label{subsec:udg}

    Ultra-diffuse galaxies represent extreme low-surface-density systems and probe
    the saturated regime across most of their extent.
    Since their systematic identification in deep imaging surveys, such systems
    have attracted considerable interest as tests of galaxy dynamics in diffuse
    environments~\cite{vanDokkum2016UDG}.

    The effective saturation model predicts that ultra-diffuse galaxies should
    exhibit slowly rising rotation curves that approach a common asymptotic
    behavior, largely independent of detailed baryonic structure.
    Significant deviations from this pattern would challenge the universality of
    the saturation scale.

    Observational studies have revealed a wide diversity of inferred dynamical mass
    content among ultra-diffuse galaxies, ranging from apparently dark-matter-rich
    systems to galaxies consistent with little or no dark matter~\cite{vanDokkum2019DF2,ManceraPina2019UDG}.
    Within the present framework, this diversity arises naturally from differences
    in how deeply individual systems probe the saturated regime.

    In ultra-diffuse galaxies, the large apparent mass discrepancy inferred from
    kinematics should therefore not be interpreted as evidence for an extended
    distribution of unseen matter.
    Rather, it reflects a geometric threshold effect: the baryonic configuration
    probes the deeply saturated regime, where further reductions in density no
    longer increase the effective dynamical response.

    As a result, the inferred dynamical mass reflects the onset of saturation
    rather than the presence of an additional gravitating component.
    The ``missing mass'' is thus not a material distribution, but an emergent
    consequence of limited geometric resolution in low-density systems.

    This interpretation leads to a falsifiable observational prediction.
    If the apparent mass discrepancy in ultra-diffuse galaxies originates from a
    geometric saturation effect rather than from a physical mass component, then
    independent mass tracers should not reveal correspondingly extended matter
    distributions.

    In particular, weak lensing signals, satellite dynamics, and stellar velocity
    dispersion profiles are expected to systematically underpredict the dynamical
    mass inferred from rotation or dispersion measurements in the deepest
    saturation regime.
    A positive detection of massive, spatially extended halos in ultra-diffuse
    galaxies would therefore directly falsify the present framework.

    Because ultra-diffuse galaxies probe the deepest saturation regime, they
    provide a particularly sensitive test of the universality of the saturation
    scale $a_\star$.

    Ultra-diffuse galaxies thus constitute a clean observational laboratory for
    distinguishing between material and geometric explanations of apparent mass
    discrepancies in the low-density regime.

  \subsection{Summary}
    \label{subsec:predictions_summary}

    The effective saturation framework yields a coherent set of predictions across
    galactic and cosmological scales.
    All predictions are driven by environmental dependence and involve no
    additional free parameters beyond the saturation scale already fixed by
    rotation curve data.

    The framework is therefore falsifiable with current or near-future
    observational capabilities.
    Confirmation or rejection of these signatures will decisively determine
    whether the proposed mechanism captures a genuine aspect of low-density
    gravitational phenomenology.
