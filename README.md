This repository contains the source of the **Low-Density Phenomenology** paper  
*A Unified Effective Mechanism for Galaxy Rotation Curves and the Hubble Tension*
(paper D).

This work presents a **phenomenological study** of late-time gravitational and
kinematic anomalies, focusing on galaxy rotation curves and the Hubble constant
tension.
The analysis is deliberately restricted to observational consequences in
low-density environments and does not propose a fundamental modification of
cosmology or gravity.

The paper builds on a minimal effective framework in which the gravitational
response saturates below a characteristic scale.
This effective description is tested against galactic and cosmological data,
without invoking dark matter particles in this regime and without modifying
early-universe physics.

## Scope and Motivation

Two long-standing observational puzzles motivate this study:

- the ubiquity of flat galaxy rotation curves across a wide range of disk
  galaxies
- the persistent discrepancy between locally inferred and early-time values of
  the Hubble constant

Although usually treated separately, both phenomena probe gravitational and
kinematic inference in **low-density regimes**.
Galaxy outskirts and ultra-diffuse systems explore weak-acceleration regions,
while cosmic voids represent the most extreme low-density environments on
cosmological scales.

This work investigates whether these anomalies may originate from a **single
effective mechanism** active primarily in diffuse environments.

## Effective Phenomenological Framework

The framework adopted in this paper is intentionally minimal.

- gravitational dynamics reduce to Newtonian behavior in high-density regimes
- deviations arise smoothly in low-density or weak-acceleration environments
- a single universal saturation scale controls the transition
- no halo-by-halo tuning or environment-specific parameters are introduced

The model is treated explicitly as an **effective late-time description**.
It does not alter early-universe observables, global cosmological evolution, or
the standard background expansion.

## Galaxy Rotation Curves

The framework is tested against galaxy rotation curve data using the SPARC
sample.

- only observed baryonic matter is included
- a universal saturation scale is used across the sample
- the diversity of rotation curve shapes arises from baryonic structure alone

The analysis focuses on qualitative behavior, residuals, and scaling relations,
rather than maximizing fitting flexibility.

## Cosmic Voids and the Hubble Tension

At cosmological scales, the same effective mechanism predicts
environment-dependent signatures in the locally inferred expansion rate.

Cosmic voids naturally probe the deeply saturated regime.
As a result, kinematic measurements performed in or near void-dominated regions
may yield systematically enhanced values of the Hubble constant relative to the
global background.

This provides a structural explanation for the Hubble tension that does not rely
on new dark components or modifications of early-time physics.

## Predictions and Falsifiability

The framework yields several testable predictions:

- correlations between locally inferred $H_0$ values and large-scale environment
- redshift-dependent suppression of the local Hubble offset
- void-specific redshift drift signatures
- weak lensing deviations associated with cosmic voids
- characteristic behavior of ultra-diffuse galaxies

These predictions allow the framework to be confirmed or excluded with current
and forthcoming observations.

## Relation to Companion Papers

This paper is part of a broader research program.
Its role is explicitly **phenomenological**.

- the dynamical motivation for bounded-response regimes is developed in a
  companion work (paper C)
- structural and projection-based considerations are discussed in papers A and B

The present repository does not rely on the full theoretical framework.
It focuses exclusively on late-time observational consequences.
